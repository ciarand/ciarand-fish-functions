@ciarand's Fish Functions
=========================

These functions represent a backup of the [Fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) functions I use on a regular basis.


Stars
-----

### `g`

An alias for git. When called without any arguments, `g` executes a `git
status`. When called with arguments it passes them to git.

### `switch_to_lf`

Fixes any issues with LF line endings by zipping the files / folders up
and then unzipping them with the appropriate flags passed.
