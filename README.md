@ciarand's Fish Functions (v1.2)
================================

These functions represent a backup of the [Fish shell](http://fishshell.com/)
functions I use on a regular basis.

They have been shamelessly stolen from around the internet.

My favorites right now are:

* Jump (`jump.fish`, `mark.fish`, `marks.fish`, `unmark.fish`)

* e (`e.fish`)
