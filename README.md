@ciarand's Fish Functions (v2.0)
================================

These functions represent a backup of the [Fish shell](http://fishshell.com/)
functions I use on a regular basis.

They have been shamelessly stolen from around the internet.

These are now *deprecated* and will not be developed. If, on the off chance
you're feeling curious, you can find the updated versions [here][].
